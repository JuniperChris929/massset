This little script takes a "commands.txt" file (JunOS set Format) and connects to either a single Device or to an IP-List (.txt or xlsx) to commit these commands (no syntax check).
The File is transferred via scp and then committed using the given username and password.
The script will not validate the commands in any way so be careful!
No netconf or other port needed - Port 22 (ssh/scp) is enough :)

Enjoy
